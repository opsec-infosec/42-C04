Evaluation Testing Code

# Note
Please don't use these to test your own code... You should at least try to call you functions from your main, you will learn so much.

## Using these test functions
Please do review the code and see how to call you own functions.  I encourage this... it helps you learn and understand.

Please use these for evaluations, this will give you more time to have discussions with your peers during the evaluation and hopefuly
some time to learn from others.

## How to Use these functions during an Eval

git clone the evaluation project as you normally do.
Then in their evaluation folder where all there exXX folder are, git clone this repository.
Then you can do a gcc ex01.c && ./a.out
Have a look at the results and read the subject.pdf...

And most importantly, have a discussion with the person you are evaluating.  You can learn a lot from these discussions.

ENJOY..

**Note:  If you find a test case or bug, please let me know so I can fix them and improve the test cases
